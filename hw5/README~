I had trouble with saving databases (I kept getting an error "file is encrypted or not a database"
from the database files i created; I believe it's a version mismatch), so I did everything in memory.
When you run "python hw5.py", the database is first populated in memory. You are then asked
if you would like to insert any extra polls. It tells you how to do so. There is no input
sanitization; if any error occurs, the prompt loop breaks and the program continues.
(So, when you're done adding polls, just hit enter.)
Then, the number of seats the democrats are poised to lose is printed. I pulled my poll data from
the linked to website at about 2:30am October 9; in my dataset, the democrats are poised to
lose 10 seats. (This is computed programmatically; see "partE()" in the script.)
Next you are asked for a state to display a web page for. You can provide a state (using capitalized
2-letter abbreviations) as many times as you like. Give a blank line when you're done.
Finally, it asks you to for a state to build a graph for. Input is just like the website and you
can go as many times as you like. Give a blank line when you're done.

Included is a graph (CA.png) and webpage (CA.html) for California.
