Part 1: If you're reading this it worked. (git clone git://github.com/djames/ay250)

Part 2: I added "DistributedPrimitives.py". I intend for this to be my final project
in this class. My plan is to adapt some code that I've written in my research, turning
it into an importable python package to provide distributed synchronization primitives
over networked agents.

Part 3: In hw8.py. I hooked it up to my hw5 solutions, which didn't save the database,
so you won't be able to save your database changes. However, you can add a poll and view
a plot of whatever state you like. Here's a sample call:

python hw8.py -p -state ca -dem 20 -gop 80 -endmonth november -endday 31 -pollster shitbricks -plot ca

The "-plot STATE" command shows a plot for STATE, and no plot is shown if it is ommitted.
There's some leeway with string input; I tried wherever it was easy to sanitize input and
take care of capitals/lowercase. So you can input your state as CA, ca, CaLiFoRnIa, etc.
(The abbreviation is the important part, so for states where the first two letters don't
equal the abbreviation, you should use the abbreviation.)

Part 4: All in bloomdemo in the repository. I wasn't able to mark my
final commit "v2.0", it didn't let me add a commit message. *sigh*.
Other than that I followed the directions. I didn't delete my branch
at the end.
