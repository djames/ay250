Not really much to say about this one. Run it with "python hw6.py". (No args.)

Most importantly: For the image search, I used the pYsearch library that Chris
linked us to in the email. I installed it on my machine, and my code depends upon
it, so you should make sure you have it installed. The code is at
http://pysearch.sourceforge.net/
It's surprisingly easy to install; the webpage has instructions. I normally
wouldn't code to dependencies without including said dependencies in the submission,
but I figured it was safe in this case since Chris recommended it. (and thanks,
it made the image query really easy.)

The initial image displayed is the plot from lecture/the mpl_figure_editor.py
code. Seemed like a reasonable enough/easy thing to do. You can't actually apply
the image manipulation functions to it, but it won't break anything if you click
the buttons.

Some queries don't return images. For example, I tried "naked hippies on acid"
and didn't get any results. When this happens, a stack trace is printed but the GUI
continues to work properly; the image/url just doesn't get updated.

IMAGE MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS:
I did a gaussian filter, a rotation, and a fourier transform. All are implemented
using the functions in scipy.ndimage (again, thanks to Chris for pointing us to this).
