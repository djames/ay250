Problem 1
Run with
python hw3p1.py <host> <port>
Optionally, run
python hw3p1.py
and the host/port will default to localhost:5020 (this is how I tested).

Designed to connect to Chris Klein's rpc server.

Uses the moonlanding.png image from hw2.

Sample output is in distorted[1-3].png and fixed[1-3].png.


Problem 2
Run with
python hw3p2.py

A list of the given sound files and the notes in them will be produced.
See comments in code for explanation of how it works.

Output is:

Notes present in sound_files/2.aif:  F3
Notes present in sound_files/3.aif:  A4
Notes present in sound_files/4.aif:  C4
Notes present in sound_files/5.aif:  F#2
Notes present in sound_files/6.aif:  C5
